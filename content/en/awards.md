While working on A Crown Fit For A Prince, Gaby also worked as Editor and Colourist, on a music video for highly acclaimed duo, Hybrid Minds. The video has had over 200K views on Youtube and came fourth in the ‘best music video’ category in the Drum & Bass Arena Awards. Considering their video was the only student production entered in to the competition, the crew were pretty chuffed to even be nominated, let alone come fourth behind the likes of groups such as Chase & Status.
