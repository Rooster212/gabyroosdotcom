Born and raised in Cambridge, Gabriella Roos is a Film editor, who studied at Brighton Film School. From the age of 14, she was sure she wanted to be a photographer and never went anywhere without her camera. However, whilst doing an A Level in Film Studies, her passion soon shifted. She was then accepted at Brighton Film School in 2015 to pursue a more practical course.

Even before starting a Brighton Film School, Gabriella’s interests were specifically around editing but she was keen to try different roles as there may have been something she enjoyed even more. Over the first two years of film school, she took on the roles of Director of Rhotography on two music videos, as well as Producer, Head of Sound and Gaffer on various short films. She even directed her own documentary called The Lady in The Pink Coat about the life of elderly viral video star, Ann Tunstall. After all this, she still always found herself back in the editing suite, cutting almost every film she worked on. By the end of her second year at Brighton Film School, she knew for sure that editing was where her skills and passion lay.

In June 2017, Gabriella shot and edited a fast paced video of Brighton named ‘Watchtower of Brighton’ which featured seamless cuts and interesting transitions to almost create the illusion of one continuous movement. This caught the attention of production company, Studio Lanta, who took her on to do a similar edit for them as well as offering her some corporate work. Watchtower of Brighton also caught Solent University’s eye who continue to show it to their film students as an example of what to strive for in their own editing.

Gabriella also worked for a production company called The Edge Picture Company, based in Covent Garden, London as a post production runner for a short term in 2016. She later filmed and edited the outtakes video for a Christmas charity video called ‘Jingle Bell Brighton Rocks’, which starred a number of local celebrities including Big Brother’s Pete Bennett and Gogglebox’s Stephen Webb, Chris Steed, and the Michaels.

Gabriella graduated in July 2018 from Brighton Film School with a 2:1 in Film Production and majored in Editing. Soon after graduating, Gaby was hired as a videographer by Tim Wildman, director at WineTutor.tv, to create educational videos for Master of Wine Students. This involved travelling to California and New Zealand to film with high profile wineries; Delicato Family Vineyards and Villa Maria.

Since then, she’s worked as a runner on various shoots such as an EE advert about 5G technology. She’s worked closely with local bands, filming and editing music videos for them, and she’s now in the pre production stages of her own short documentary based in Cambridge. Gaby is always open and interested in new experiences and welcomes all work opportunities in the film industry.
